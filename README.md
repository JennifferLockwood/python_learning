# Python Learning

In the course of learning Python, I learned the basics of the language through study and short programming exercises in two books, *Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science*, by John Zelle, and *Python Crash Course*, by Eric Matthes.  I also completed the Django beginners tutorial and to improve my understanding of one of the sections in the book, and consulted other tutorials and reference material as needed.  

To refresh and improve my Git and Github skills, I did frequent commits and pushes of my work, especially later on in my study.
